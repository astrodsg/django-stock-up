# StockUp #

This project was created as a for-fun django website. The concept is to create a stock buying website. Users create accounts and begin with 10000 StockBucks (extra StockBucks can be purchased with Paypal at an exchange rate of 1 StockBuck==$20 US Dollars). The users then get to query current US stock prices and choose to buy/sell stocks (1 StockBuck==1 US Dollar). Based on various metrics, users can measure their success at selling their stocks for mor StockBucks than they paid for them.
